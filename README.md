# GIS-API-Challenge
### Part I of the project, WeatherPy, uses GIS data obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API to demonstrate statistically how the weather changes as you approach the equator from the poles. Part II, VacationPy, builds on Part I and uses the file of current weather produced in Part I along with a GIS function from the Google Maps Places API to plan a vacation.

### API keys for OpenWeatherMap and Google Maps are required to run the Jupyter Notebooks. WeatherPy outputs a log of weather retrieved for each city and a series of figures from the regression analysis. VacationPy includes an interactive web map of gardens located near cities that meet ideal weather criteria.

### The project utilizes the following data analytics tools and methodologies:The OpenWeatherMap API, the Google Maps Places API, the citipy library, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, SciPy, the gmaps plugin, JSON traversals, and Jupyter Notebook
